I   have   searched   for   ways   to   open   and   read   an   excel   document   and   I   found   some   information   which   I   thought   that   I   would   document.     Information   on   the   object   model   to   help   with   programming   COM   objects   can   be   found   in   your   MS   Office   help   files,   search   for   VBA*.chm. 
Also,   here   is   a   script   that   I   used   to   pull   a   cell   from   each   worksheet,   complete   w/   variable   for   pathnames   &   worksheets.     This   script   also   closes   excel   completely.     The   coding   might   be   dirty,   but   it   gets   the   job   done.
